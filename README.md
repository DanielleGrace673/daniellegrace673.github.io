# About Me
## My Interests
 I mostly enjoy just spending my time reading or hanging out with my animals and roomates. I love learning new things, which is why I wanted to start learning programming. 
## Websites I recommend 
 * [Color With Gracelyn](https://colorwithgracelyn.com/)- This website is good for unwinding, if you like coloring and word search puzzles. It offers free downloadable coloring pages and puzzles.
 * [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)- An interesting programming course that is offered for free online.
