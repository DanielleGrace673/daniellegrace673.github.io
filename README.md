# About Me
## My Interests
 I mostly enjoy just spending my time reading or hanging out with my animals and roomates. I love learning new things, which is why I wanted to start learning programming. Most of the time I'm reading fantasy novels, but lately I've been trying to branch out into suspense and thriller novels. I also wanted to start learning programming because I would like to begin a new career in the IT field. I've always worked in customer service, so I'm eager for a change. 
## Websites I recommend 
 * [Color With Gracelyn](https://colorwithgracelyn.com/)- This website is good for unwinding, if you like coloring and word search puzzles. It offers free downloadable coloring pages and puzzles. It's a pretty simple website to navigate, and to download a coloring page or puzzle all you have to do is click on the image and follow the download prompts. 
 * [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)- An interesting programming course that is offered for free online. This is where my interest in programming started, but I wanted to earn a degree through a college.
